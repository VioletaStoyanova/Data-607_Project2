#The objective of Project 2 is to prepare data for downstream analysis. The following datasets were obtained from fivethirtyeight. com.
#1. The first dataset that I worked with intends to prove the polarization of votes on Al Gore's sequel documentary called "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power." Movie ratings on a scale from 1 to 10 don't seem to be accurate and reliable.
